# GaryLarsonDiscordBot

<b><i>STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</i></b>

<b><i>Learning Purpose of this Project:</b> To learn and use Discord's public API to create a Discord bot with web-scraping capabilities.</i>

This repository hosts a project that involves a Discord bot retrieving daily comics from the Far Side, created by the American cartoonist, Gary Larson. This bot can join any server and will have several features, such as being able to send Far Side quotes into a server's chat, scrape Far Side comics from the internet to put into chat, etc. The bot itself is hosted using Heroku.
